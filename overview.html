                <p>I'm a proficient programmer with over 5 years of experience across a range of languages, technologies, and paradigms. I pride myself on writing robust, elegant, and efficient programs, and consider myself to have a strong intuition for engineering complex and flexible systems from the ground up. Equally, I am adept at quickly grasping the structure of existing codebases, which allows me to hit the ground running and begin making constructive improvements to existing projects from from Day 1.</p>
<p>Through several years of self-directed study, I have developed a broad and well-developed understanding of both the theoretical and practical aspects of Computer Science and Software Engineering. I am particuarly interested in the development of system software, especially compiler design, although my interests are broad and have touched upon fields as diverse as robotics and web development.</p>
